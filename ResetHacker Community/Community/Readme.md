- What is community?
A group of people sharing a common characteristic or interest.
(Communities can exist and gather virtually or IRL.) 


- Commmunity Manager is a community member who is responsible for ensuring and growing the stickiness in the community  which allows members to together move toward common mission.

- Community managers role?
   Community moderation , content strategy, building member relationships, member growth and engagements.


- Community-based marketing?

  But why are we seeing a growing interest in community based marketing all of a sudden?
  I think It's a part of evolution of the brand-user relationship.

  - Brands are looking to understand and serve their users even better in an increasing competitive market.

  - On the other hand, users seek for more than a transactional relationship with brands because they have multiple options.
    They are losing trust in traditional marketing tactics such as advertisements.
    They look into communities and reviews as a basis of trust. Additionally, they seem to want increased support from brands, platforms to share experiences (of the products/services), a sense of belonging and a shared culture with other users of the brand. 
    
- Community growth hacking 
is an experiment-driven technique to determine the most effective ways of growing a community. 
		The process involves a mix of marketing, content, creativity, and analytics.
		The reason why it’s called growth hacking is that a hacker finds a quick, cost-effective but innovative method to attain growth instead of following conventional processes. 

	eg:
 	leverge referal marketing, 
 	find social media platforms your competitors aren't using (indirectly talking about your community)
 	partner with another company to share to share audiances
 	Content marketing A/B testing.
