Title: "Learn in Your Mother Tongue"

Objective: To encourage people to learn programming, in their mother tongue and make it more accessible to non-native English speakers.

Target audience: Non-native English speakers who are interested in learning programming.

Key message: Learning programming in your mother tongue can make it easier to understand and more accessible for non-native English speakers.

Strategy:

    Develop online coding courses in multiple languages that cater to the needs and preferences of our target audience. 
    Create social media and email marketing campaigns.
    Partner with influencers, educators, and organizations in the tech and education communities to spread awareness of our campaign and courses. We will work with them to create co-branded content, share our message on their platforms, and offer discounts or other incentives to their audiences.
    Offer a free trial of our courses to encourage more people to try them out. This will allow potential students to get a taste of our courses and see the benefits of learning programming in their mother tongue.
    Measure and track the success of our campaign through various metrics such as course enrollment, social media engagement, email open rates, and student feedback. This will allow us to identify areas for improvement and make changes as necessary to achieve our goals.

Expected Outcome: 
By the end of the campaign, we expect to see a significant increase in the number of people learning programming in their mother tongue. 
This will be measured by an increase in course enrollment, positive feedback from students, and engagement on our social media and email marketing campaigns. 
The success of the campaign has led to the creation of additional educational resources and the expansion of the campaign's reach to more languages and communities.
